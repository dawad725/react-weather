# react-weather

This is a fun application that I built to focus on learning and using functional components, react hooks, and Material UI. 

# using npm 
-git clone https://github.com/dawad725/react-weather.git;
-cd react-weather && cd server && npm install && npm start;
-cd react-weather cd server cd client npm install npm start;
